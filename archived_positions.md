# archived positions
A position should be added to the archive list after removing it from the main README.md file. This occurs after a deadline has passed or a specific program is no longer accepting applications. This archive is valuable as it can help prospective researchers, as well as those running labs, understand existing and past projects within consideration of the current HCI research landscape. PRs to move listing from the README.md to this file (aka an update) are encouraged!
