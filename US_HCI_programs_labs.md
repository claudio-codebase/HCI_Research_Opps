# What is HCI?
Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) is research in the design and the use of computer technology, which focuses on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways. (via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction#:~:text=Human%E2%80%93computer%20interaction%20(HCI),with%20computers%20in%20novel%20ways.))

### Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institute, Human and Robots Partners Lab

**Type:** Research Group

**Location:** Pittsburgh, PA

**Mission Statement and/or Research Focus:** Develop autonomous, intelligent robots that help people live better. Their robots engage people through social and physical interactions, monitoring human behavior to understand and predict the types of help people need. Application domains include assistive robot manipulators for people with motor impairments, robot tutors for education, and robot therapy assistants for people with cognitive or social disabilities.

**Participant Type:** Faculty, Post-Doc, Phd Students, Masters Students, Undergraduates
