# What is HCI?
Human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI) is research in the design and the use of computer technology, which focuses on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways. (via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction#:~:text=Human%E2%80%93computer%20interaction%20(HCI),with%20computers%20in%20novel%20ways.))
