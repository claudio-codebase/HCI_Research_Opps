# why YOU should contribute
Contributing to this repo is an incredible opportunity to expand access in HCI research. If you are a professor, PI, grad student, or have any relation to research, this is an excellent opportunity to reach out to new people who are not necessarily already tapped into your network. If you are an undergraduate, graduate, or prospective student looking for research opportunities, this is an excellent opportunity to find AND SHARE the opportunities you might come across. In either case, you will likely come across openings or be looking for people to staff your labs. When an opportunity arises, please contribute it to our README.md or other (future) files in this repo. Thank you for your help!

For privacy reasons, please do not list any specific contacts (emails, names) in an entry, instead, note that they can be found following a link or another location.
